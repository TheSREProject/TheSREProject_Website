            <h1>How I Became an SRE in One Year</h1>
            <p class="post-meta">January 2026 · Seth Black</p>

            <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>Four years ago, I had zero IT experience. No degree in computer science. No certifications. No clue what an SRE even was.</p>

                <p>One year later, I was working as an SRE at a large enterprise alongside engineers with decades of experience.</p>

                <p>This is how it happened.</p>

                <h2>The Starting Point</h2>

                <p>I knew Sean Fretenborough through mutual connections. He'd been working in enterprise IT for over two decades - the kind of experience you can't fake. When I mentioned I was interested in getting into tech, he didn't point me to a bootcamp or tell me to get a certification. He said something that changed my trajectory:</p>

                <p>"I'll teach you the way I learned. I'll give you topics to study. You research them, then we talk about what you found."</p>

                <p>That was the deal. No structured curriculum. No hand-holding. Just a list of topics and the expectation that I'd figure it out.</p>

                <h2>The Method</h2>

                <p>Every week or two, Sean would give me something to research. Sometimes it was broad - "learn about DNS." Sometimes it was specific - "understand how TCP handshakes work." Sometimes it was practical - "set up a Linux VM and get comfortable with the command line."</p>

                <p>My job was to go find the information. Read documentation. Watch videos. Set up lab environments. Break things. Fix them. Then come back and explain what I learned.</p>

                <p>The conversations were the real education. Sean would ask questions I hadn't thought of. He'd poke holes in my understanding. He'd share war stories from enterprise environments that put the theory into context. "That's how it works in textbooks. Here's what actually happens at 2am when a production system is down."</p>

                <h2>What I Actually Studied</h2>

                <p>Looking back at that year, here's roughly what I covered:</p>

                <p><strong>Foundations (Months 1-3)</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Linux basics - navigation, permissions, processes, services</li>

                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Command line proficiency - bash, common utilities, piping</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Version control with Git</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Systems (Months 4-6)</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How web servers work - Apache, Nginx</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Databases - SQL basics, how to query and troubleshoot</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Monitoring concepts - what to measure and why</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Logs - where they live, how to read them, what to look for</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Automation (Months 7-9)</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Scripting with Python - start small, automate real tasks</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">PowerShell basics - essential for Windows environments</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Infrastructure as code concepts</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">CI/CD pipelines - what they are and why they matter</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Cloud & SRE (Months 10-12)</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Cloud fundamentals - AWS and Azure basics</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">SRE principles - SLIs, SLOs, error budgets</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Incident response - how to approach problems systematically</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">On-call expectations - what it actually means to be responsible for production</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Hard Parts</h2>

                <p>I won't pretend it was easy. Some weeks I spent 20+ hours on a single topic. There were moments where I felt completely lost - staring at documentation that assumed knowledge I didn't have, Googling terms from the Google results.</p>

                <p>The hardest part wasn't the technical content. It was the uncertainty. Bootcamps give you a clear path - complete these modules, pass this test, get this certificate. Self-directed learning doesn't work that way. I constantly wondered: Am I learning the right things? Am I going deep enough? Will this actually lead to a job?</p>

                <p>Sean's guidance was the anchor. When I went down rabbit holes that didn't matter, he'd redirect me. When I was avoiding topics I found intimidating, he'd push me toward them. When I felt like I wasn't making progress, he'd point out how far I'd come.</p>

                <h2>Getting the Job</h2>

                <p>After about a year, Sean told me there was an opening on his team. He thought I was ready.</p>

                <p>The interview was technical. They asked me to troubleshoot scenarios, explain concepts, talk through how I'd approach problems. I didn't know everything - not even close. But I knew how to think about systems. I knew how to find answers. I knew enough to be useful and learn the rest on the job.</p>

                <p>I got the offer.</p>

                <h2>What Made This Work</h2>

                <p>Looking back, a few things made this approach successful:</p>

                <p><strong>1. A mentor who was invested</strong></p>
                <p>Sean didn't just give me topics and disappear. He made time for conversations. He answered questions. He cared whether I succeeded. Not everyone has access to this, and I don't take it for granted.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Self-direction with guardrails</strong></p>
                <p>I had to do the work myself - nobody was going to spoon-feed me. But Sean kept me pointed in the right direction. Pure self-teaching would have taken twice as long with half the results.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Practical application</strong></p>
                <p>Every topic connected to real work. I wasn't learning theory for certification exams. I was learning skills I'd actually use. That made it stick.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Consistent effort over time</strong></p>
                <p>A year of steady work beats a month of cramming. I studied most days, even when it was just an hour. The compound effect is real.</p>

                <h2>Four Years Later</h2>

                <p>I'm now a Senior SRE. I've worked through a major ransomware attack. I've mentored interns myself. I work with AWS, Azure, Python, PowerShell, and increasingly, AI tools like Claude Code.</p>

                <p>None of it would have happened without that first year of guided self-study.</p>

                <h2>If You're Starting Out</h2>

                <p>You don't need a CS degree. You don't need expensive bootcamps. You don't need to know someone who'll give you a job.</p>

                <p>What you need:</p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">A clear list of topics to study (I'll share mine in future posts)</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">The discipline to study consistently</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Hands-on practice - reading isn't enough</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Someone to learn from, even if it's just online communities</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you can find a mentor willing to guide you, take it. That's the fast track. If you can't, the path is still open - it just requires more trial and error.</p>

                <p>The SRE Project exists because we believe this approach works. Sean taught me. Now we want to teach others.</p>

                <p>Start with one topic. Learn it well. Then move to the next.</p>

                <p>One year from now, you'll be amazed how far you've come.</p>
