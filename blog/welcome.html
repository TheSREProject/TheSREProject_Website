            <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>Welcome to The SRE Project blog. We're two engineers who've spent years working in enterprise IT, and we're here to share what we've learned about Site Reliability Engineering, automation, and building systems that actually work.</p>

                <h2>Why This Blog Exists</h2>
                <p>Sean has been doing this for over 24 years. Seth learned through a year of intensive mentorship-studying topics assigned by a seasoned engineer, then applying that knowledge to real enterprise systems. That approach worked well enough to land a job at a large enterprise, working side by side.</p>

                <p>We started The SRE Project to formalize that mentorship model and share it with others. This blog is part of that effort. Here, we'll write about the things we wish someone had told us earlier, the patterns that actually work at scale, and the mistakes we've made along the way.</p>

                <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
                <p>Expect posts on:</p>
